# Common Music

Common Music is a music composition system that transforms high-level algorithmic representations of musical processes  
and structure into a variety of control protocols for sound synthesis and display. by CCRMA  
  
but recently CommonMusic3 doesn't support CommonLisp and too old.  
This fork are minimal version of CommonMusic2 only include algorithmic musical library,   
remove deprecated / meaningless part for me(sc, midi etc..).  
  
If you need full version Common Music, you can get it [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/commonmusic/files/cm/).
